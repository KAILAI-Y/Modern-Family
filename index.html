        <h2>Main Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Modern Family</strong>is an American television mockumentary family sitcom created by Christopher
            Lloyd and Steven Levitan for American Broadcasting Company. <strong>Modern Family</strong> revolves around
            three different types of families (nuclear, step- and same-sex) living in the Los Angeles area, who are
            interrelated through Jay Pritchett and his children, Claire Dunphy and Mitchell Pritchett.
            Patriarch Jay is remarried to a much younger woman, Gloria Delgado Pritchett, a passionate
            woman with whom he has a young son, Fulgencio Joseph "Joe" Pritchett, and a son from Gloria's previous
            marriage, Manuel Manny Delgado.

            Jay's daughter Claire was a homemaker, but has returned to the business world. She is now the chief
            executive of her father's business, Pritchett's Closets and Blinds. She is married to Phil Dunphy, a realtor
            and a self-professed "cool dad". They have three children: Haley Dunphy, a stereotypical ditzy teenage girl;
            Alex Dunphy, a nerdy, smart middle child; and Luke Dunphy, the off-beat only son.

            Jay's lawyer son Mitchell and his husband Cameron Tucker have one adopted daughter, Lily Tucker-Pritchett.
            As the name suggests, this family represents a modern-day family and episodes are comically based on
            situations that many families encounter in real life.
